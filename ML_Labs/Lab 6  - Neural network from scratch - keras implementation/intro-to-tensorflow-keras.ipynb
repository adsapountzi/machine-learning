    "Note: you can run **[this notebook, live in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/eager.ipynb)** with zero setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to use machine learning to *categorize* Iris flowers by species. It uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)'s eager execution to (1) build a *model*, (2) *train* the model on example data, and (3) use the model to make *predictions* on unknown data. Machine learning experience isn't required to follow this guide, but you'll need to read some Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There many [TensorFlow APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/) available, but we recommend starting with these high-level TensorFlow concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enable an [eager execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/eager) development environment,\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow's eager execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import data with the [Datasets API](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets),\n",
    "* Build models and layers with TensorFlow's [Keras API](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows these APIs and is structured like many other TensorFlow programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import and parse the data sets.\n",
    "2. Select the type of model.\n",
    "3. Train the model.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "5. Use the trained model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about using TensorFlow, see the [Getting Started guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/) and the [example tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). If you'd like to learn about the basics of machine learning, consider taking the [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).\n",

    "This tutorial is available as an interactive [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com) for you to run and change the Python code directly in the browser. The notebook handles setup and dependencies while you \"play\" cells to execute the code blocks. This is a fun way to explore the program and test ideas. If you are unfamiliar with Python notebook environments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Executing code requires connecting to a runtime environment. In the Colab notebook menu, select *Runtime > Connect to runtime...*\n",
    "2. Notebook cells are arranged sequentially to gradually build the program. Typically, later code cells depend on prior code cells, though you can always rerun a code block. To execute the entire notebook in order, select *Runtime > Run all*. To rerun a code cell, select the cell and click the *play icon* on the left."

    "\n",
    "A *[model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/glossary#model)* is the relationship between features and the label.  For the Iris classification problem, the model defines the relationship between the sepal and petal measurements and the predicted Iris species. Some simple models can be described with a few lines of algebra, but complex machine learning models have a large number of parameters that are difficult to summarize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you determine the relationship between the four features and the Iris species *without* using machine learning?  That is, could you use traditional programming techniques (for example, a lot of conditional statements) to create a model?  Perhaps—if you analyzed the dataset long enough to determine the relationships between petal and sepal measurements to a particular species. And this becomes difficult—maybe impossible—on more complicated datasets. A good machine learning approach *determines the model for you*. If you feed enough representative examples into the right machine learning model type, the program will figure out the relationships for you.\n",

This tutorial uses a neural network to solve the Iris classification problem. *[Neural networks](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#neural_network)* can find complex relationships between features and the label. It is a highly-structured graph, organized into one or more *[hidden layers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#hidden_layer)*. Each hidden layer consists of one or more *[neurons](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#neuron)*. There are several categories of neural networks and this program uses a dense, or *[fully-connected neural network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#fully_connected_layer)*: the neurons in one layer receive input connections from *every* neuron in the previous layer. For example, Figure 2 illustrates a dense neural network consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer:\n",

In Figure 2, this prediction breaks down as: `0.03` for *Iris setosa*, `0.95` for *Iris versicolor*, and `0.02` for *Iris virginica*. This means that the model predicts—with 95% probability—that an unlabeled example flower is an *Iris versicolor*."

    "*Evaluating* means determining how effectively the model makes predictions. To determine the model's effectiveness at Iris classification, pass some sepal and petal measurements to the model and ask the model to predict what Iris species they represent. Then compare the model's prediction against the actual label.  For example, a model that picked the correct species on half the input examples has an *[accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#accuracy)* of `0.5`. Figure 4 shows a slightly more effective model, getting 4 out of 5 predictions correct at 80% accuracy:\n",
